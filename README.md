# CSE 2500: Introduction to Discrete Systems (Spring 2025)

This repository contains my coursework for **CSE 2500-001: Introduction to Discrete Systems** at the University of Connecticut, Spring 2025.

## üìò Course Overview

In this course, we explore the foundations of discrete mathematics essential to computer science. Topics include:

- Propositional and predicate logic
- Proof techniques (direct, indirect, induction)
- Sets and functions
- Recurrence relations
- Sequences and mathematical induction
- Boolean algebra and paradoxes

By the end of the course, we will be able to:
- Write precise, formal mathematical proofs
- Evaluate the soundness of logical arguments
- Solve problems involving recurrence and discrete structures
